Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of data recorded by specialized harnesses or smartphones into known well-defined Human activities.


It involves predicting the movement of a body, based on the sensor data, and involves deep knowledge of the domain from signal processing to correctly measure the features from the data to fit into a machine learning model.

It is a challenging problem as the large number of observations are produced each second, the temporal nature of the observations, and the lack of a clear way to relate data to known movements increase the challenges.

In this Machine Learning Project, we will create a model for recognition of human activity using the smartphone data.
